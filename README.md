### Initial Problem:
New NPBHS Students have trouble finding their classes.

### Background:
Year 9s and new students at High School have a large transition from their previous school to New Plymouth Boys High School, It is often daunting for them to be introduced into much bigger school, with different and varied classes. I want to make it easier for them to find their class if they have forgotten where it is or if they turned up to the wrong class. A simple map of the school can be easily found on the school website or google maps. Unfortunately the school map and google maps do not show the individual classrooms as needed by the students. My stakeholders and I have discussed in my previous design brief that a Web Application (Written with HTML, CSS & Javascript) with wayfinding would be the most suitable project to pursue as it is easily accessible among other advantages.
